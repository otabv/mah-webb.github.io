# Interaction Technology DA606A

Welcome to the course Interaction technology! There will be **no class the first week, on 21 Jan** because I will be teaching abroad that week. Instead the first class will be on 28 Jan. There are some preparations you will have to do before we meet on 28 Jan. Please make sure this is done before the first class as we will need it from start. 

All the preparation necessary are found in the instructions for [Workshop 1](workshops/ws1.html). Please note that you **do not** have to buy the course literature found in the syllabus, instead you need to get some material that you will find more information about in the instructions for Workshop 1.   

##General information about the course

We will use the [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) platform throughout the course. We will start with a series of workshops learning the Arduino step by step. The course is assessed by a project at the end of the course.
