# Workshop 6 - Getting internet access behind routers and Introduction to the project

##How to connect behind a router

Our Arduinos with Ethernet shields have a global static IP-address that can be accessed from everywhere, not only from within the network of Malmö university. However, in the real world this is often not the case. Most times, devices are connected behind routers with a local IP-address inside the local network, and another IP-address (the IP-address of the router) outside of the router. This is usually fine for applications acting as web clients, but it does not work for applications acting as web servers. There are various ways of solving this, such as

- port forwarding
- using services such as [Spacebrew](http://docs.spacebrew.cc), [Autobahn](http://autobahn.ws), [Yaler](https://yaler.net), [Temboo](https://temboo.com) or [OpenHAB](http://www.openhab.org). There is some more info on this in [this blog post](http://asynkronix.se/internet-of-things-with-arduino-yun-and-yaler/).

##Final project 

The remaining weeks of the course will be devoted to your own project. The project can be done by one student or a group of 2 students. Your are quite free to choose your topic for the project but there are some requirements:1. The project must include **connected objects**. The connection can for example be through wifi, zigbee, ethernet or mobile phone network2. The connected object must contain **sensors**3. The project must contain some kind of **visualisation**. The visualisation must in some way be connected to the sensors of the connected object. The visualisation can be purely aesthetic, or for example a graph.  4. Meaningful or fun or both (but not boring and meaningless)5. It is highly recommended, but not required, if some online services such as xively.com, ifttt.com or zapier.com are integrated in the project. 6. You may use sensors, shields and other stuff available in the lab and you can also make a wish for other sensors that we might buy. There is a limited budget for this ca SEK400 per project. Good sources for finding sensors and shilds are [Electrokit](http://www.electrokit.com) and [Kjell & Company](http://kjell.co). Please note that sometimes it takes a week or two to deliver your orders. Make sure to save your receipts so you can be refunded. Add the stuff you would like to buy to this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-5WYF-eJ51sjIHxpTlw2iusw0XwMd58_gIJpGP4a6k0/edit?usp=sharing).###Important dates
- 3 March: Add a description of what problem you are trying to solve, and what hardware and software you intend to use, and with whom you are going to work. Add it to this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-5WYF-eJ51sjIHxpTlw2iusw0XwMd58_gIJpGP4a6k0/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to contact me in advance to discuss your ideas. - 23 March 23:55: Submit a minimum three page report of your project, including background and solution on It's learning- 25 March: Demo your working prototype###SupervisionI will be available in the  lab each Wednesday afternoon giving supervision.
