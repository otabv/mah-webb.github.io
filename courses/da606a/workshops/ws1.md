# Course introduction - self studies


## Step 1 - Get some material

We will use the Arduino microcontroller throughout the course. If you don't have it already, you will need a get starter kit. There is no course literature so you won't have to buy any books. You can chose from two different starter kits:

- Alternative A:  [Electrokit starterkit](http://www.electrokit.com/mah-starterkit-for-arduino-rev-3.49175) 
- Alternative B:  [Kjell och company startkit](http://www.kjell.com/sortiment/el/elektronik/mikrokontroller/arduino/start-kit-for-arduino-p87966#ProductDetailedInformation) and [Kjell och company Arduino Uno](http://www.kjell.com/sortiment/el/elektronik/mikrokontroller/arduino/arduino-uno-rev3-p87860)

If you already have an Arduino, you only have to get the Kjell och company startkit in alternative B. 

## Step 2 - install the Arduino IDE

Go to http://arduino.cc and download the Arduino IDE to your computer and install it. 

The Arduino programs are called sketches and are made on any standard computer with the Arduino Integrated Development Environment. It is then downloaded to the Arduino, and after that, the Arduino can work by itself. The IDE can be downloaded at

[arduino.cc -> Download](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software#toc2)

Installation instructions:

- [Windows](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows)
- [Mac](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/MacOSX)
