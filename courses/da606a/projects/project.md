# Project

## Final project 

The remaining weeks of the course will be devoted to your own project. The project can be done by one student or a group of 2 students. Your are quite free to choose your topic for the project but there are some requirements:1. The project must include **connected objects**. The connection can for example be through wifi, zigbee, bluetooth, ethernet or mobile phone network. This is probably the cheapest wifi module for Arduino: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QZkCQSHnko>. The Arduino Yun is an Arduino with built in Wifi that is very good but more expensive. 2. The connected object must contain **sensors**3. The project must contain some kind of **visualisation**. The visualisation must in some way be connected to the sensors of the connected object. The visualisation can be purely aesthetic, or for example a graph.  4. It is highly recommended, but not required, if some online services such as xively.com, websockets or zapier.com are integrated in the project. 5. You may use sensors, shields and other stuff available in the lab and you can also make a wish for other sensors that we might buy. There is a limited budget for this ca SEK400 per project. Good sources for finding sensors and shilds are [Electrokit](http://www.electrokit.com) and [Kjell & Company](http://kjell.com). Please note that sometimes it takes a week or two to deliver your orders. Make sure to save your receipts so you can be refunded. Add the stuff you would like to buy to this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RkimujxlGFIpV-FqxhBdi9RsrqYjmA9nQ_hVjN6r3HA/edit?usp=sharing).### Important dates
- 24 Feb 23:55: Add a description of what problem you are trying to solve, and what hardware and software you intend to use, and with whom you are going to work. Add it to this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RkimujxlGFIpV-FqxhBdi9RsrqYjmA9nQ_hVjN6r3HA/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to contact me in advance to discuss your ideas. - 22 March 23:55: Submit a minimum three page report of your project, including background and solution on It's learning- 24 March: Demo your working prototype### SupervisionThere will be supervision available in the lab each Thursday morning.
